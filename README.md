## Brendan D. Shea, PhD

Welcome to my GitHub! I am a quantitative marine ecologist broadly interested in animal movement ecology, fisheries science, spatial analyses, predator-prey dyanamics, and marine protected areas. I reecently completed my PhD at Virginia Tech (December 2025) and am currently seeking opportunities. 

I am currently working primarily with Log Gaussian Cox Process models fit through Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation fit to disparate, unstructured datasets of animal occurrences, though I also have ongoing projects focused on evaluating the ontogenetic variation in space use of large mobile sharks and assessing the drivers of off-shelf/deep sea habitat use in coastal shark species.

I'm always interested in collaborating on projects regarding animal movement (track processing / analysis, etc.), specifically projects looking to improve the accuracy of light-level geolocation models, or developing big data integration workflows to synthesize disparate data at broad scales.
